# X-MAS-CTF-2020
This was my first attempt at a CTF after being recently introduced to the concept. I challenged a friend and we set to try and do as many challenges as possible.
Personally, I also had the goal of trying to understand how the different types of areas worked and which ones I had most insterest!
The format of the CTF allowed for just that, specially with the adding of new challenges every other day as well as a good and active community ond discord.
Great description of the competition can be found in the official competition website: <https://xmas.htsp.ro/home>
