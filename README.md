# X-MAS-CTF-2020
This was my first attempt at a CTF after being recently introduced to the concept. I challenged a friend and we set to try and do as many challenges as possible.
Personally, I also had the goal of trying to understand how the different types of areas worked and which ones I had most insterest!
The format of the CTF allowed for just that, specially with the adding of new challenges every other day as well as a good and active community ond discord.
Great description of the competition can be found in the official competition website: <https://xmas.htsp.ro/home>

This will be my first attempt at write ups, so any suggestions let me know! Here is my discord Franfrancisco9 #0105

*Note: For every challenge I will present the points they had at the end of the competition / the points at the begginning as the platform adjusted the difficulty according to how many teams have solved the challenge*

*Note 2: For every challenge I will give my personall evaluation of difficulty and enjoyment*
